# Installation

## Windows

On Windows, go to https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install and follow the instructions for installing Rust. At some point in the installation, you’ll receive a message explaining that you’ll also need the MSVC build tools for Visual Studio 2013 or later.

To acquire the build tools, you’ll need to install Visual Studio 2022. When asked which workloads to install, include:

- “Desktop Development with C++”
- The Windows 10 or 11 SDK
- The English language pack component, along with any other language pack of your choosing

Check if rust is installed:
```bash
rustc --version
```
