Cargo is Rustâ€™s build system and package manager. Most Rustaceans use this tool to manage their Rust projects because Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you, such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on, and building those libraries. (We call the libraries that your code needs dependencies.)

```bash
$ cargo new hello_cargo
$ cd hello_cargo
```

### Compile

```bash
$ cargo build
   Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.85 secs
```

### Run

$ ./target/debug/hello_cargo # or .\target\debug\hello_cargo.exe on Windows
Hello, world!
```

### Compile & run

```bash
$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
